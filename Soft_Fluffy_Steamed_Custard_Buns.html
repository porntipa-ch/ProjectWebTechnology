                                    <p><img class="iconlist" src="./images/restaurant.png"><span class="bold">Step 1  </span>Place the flour, instant yeast, sugar, and cooking oil in a mixing bowl. If you are using a stand mixer, use a dough hook attachment. Gradually add in liquid. If the dough still a bit dry, add a bit of water or milk. Add more teaspoon by teaspoon until the dough comes together and continue to knead for 5 minutes</p><br>

                                    <p><img class="iconlist" src="./images/restaurant.png"><span class="bold">Step 1  </span>If you are kneading by hands, mix everything until you get a rough dough (it's not going to be smooth yet). Cover and rest it for 15 minutes. Then go back and knead it. You'll be surprised by how easier it is to knead it now. Knead until the dough is smooth and pliable, about 10-15 minutes. Add liquid as needed. At any point during kneading, you can always stop and rest the dough if you find it hard to knead. This is to relax the gluten. Then go back to knead again and you'll be surprised by the difference it makes by just resting the dough before kneading again. It's easier for you too</p><br>

Divide equally into 12 pieces. Work with one piece at a time and cover the rest to prevent drying. Flatten the dough with your palm and use a small rolling pin to roll into a circle about 5-6 inches in diameter and the middle is slightly thicker. Don't roll the dough out too thin too</p><br>
                                    <p><img class="iconlist" src="./images/restaurant.png"><span class="bold">Step 2  </span>Place the custard filling ball on the center of the wrapper and gather all the sides to the middle and pinch to seal. Place it on a parchment paper seam side down. Continue with the rest and place the bao on a large tray cover with a large clean towel</p><br>

If it's winter where you are, you can use your oven "bread proof" function to let them proof in there, or simply turn on your oven to the lowest temperature and then turn off and after 15 minutes, place the shaped buns in there to let them proof. They won't necessarily double in size, but at least puff up to about 50% of the original size. This may take about 30 mins to 1 hour at a warm temperature. Don't go by the time however. The buns will feel lighter and when you push it gently with your finger, it will spring back slowly. These buns are ready to be steamed</p><br>

Place the buns in there, leaving about 1-inch space in between. Cover with a lid but leaving it about 1/4-inch gap for some steam to escape. Steam on medium heat for 10 minutes</p><br>

They won't be frozen yet, but firm enough. Transfer to a freezer bag and they won't stick to each other anymore. They can be kept in the freezer for up to 1 month for the best result. You can thaw them overnight in the fridge and then steam them for 5 minutes to reheat or steam them from frozen for 10 minutes or until heated through</p><br>
